# Our Story

Marina and Josh grew up in Frankfort, Kentucky and attended the same high
school, though they didn't actually meet during their one-year overlap there.
Amelia, Josh's sister and Marina's friend, introduced them, and they started
dating in 2012. They bonded over their love of music, dogs, and sushi. Their
love stood the test of time and distance, from the early days when Josh
attended the University of Louisville and Marina went to high school in
Frankfort, to their time apart when Marina moved to Los Angeles to study at
the University of Southern California.

Upon graduation, Josh moved to LA and accepted a job at a small software
security startup, finally ending the distance between the two after a year
and a half. In 2015, Josh adopted Max, an energetic and cuddly small white
poodle, from the local animal shelter. Marina quickly grew to love her new
"study buddy" and they have been inseparable ever since... Max has even
learned to fly on the plane!

In 2017, Marina graduated from USC with her sights set on Medical School at
the University of Virginia. During their post-graduation vacation to the
island of Kauai, Josh proposed at sunset along the beach. After the trip,
belongings were once again piled into a vehicle to embark on yet another
cross-country drive. This time, however, a moving truck was required, and
more stops along the way were planned. They drove the truck from LA to
Frankfort, KY, and then to Charlottesville, Virginia, stopping at five
national parks along the way. They now reside in Charlottesville where Marina
is a Med student, Josh works from home at the same job he got when moving to
LA, and Max is incredibly happy to laze on the couch when not zooming around
the apartment.
